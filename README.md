# FitLit
## üìù Description
FitLit is an app that displays a user's fitness data with graphs to encourage the user's exercise habits.  

At the start of the project we combined several design inspirations and came up with a wireframe for our User-Interface.  

We divided the work evenly and made use of chart.js for the first time to generate graphs.    

## Context
FitLit is our first group project from Module 2 at Turing School of Software & Design.  

So far in this mod we've learned to make network requests and write our own unit tests.  

This project was our first chance to practice accessing API data.  

## Learning Goals and Objectives
1. Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.  
2. Create a user interface that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.  
3. Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity. 
4. Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.  
5. Make network requests to retrieve data.  
6. Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project.
